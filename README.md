# VCFify

A very straightforward, non-random contact generator capable of exporting contacts in a vCard-compatible format. 

To launch this script, you will only need Python installed on your system, but the margin is too small to teach how to install it.

When launching it,

1. you will be asked to enter a telephone number, which must be entered in international format, including the [country telephone prefix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mobile_telephone_prefixes_by_country),
2. which will generate a vCard format file with the .vcf extension, which you can use to import them to any mobile device.

Enjoy it!
